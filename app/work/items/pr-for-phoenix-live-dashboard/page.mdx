# Refactor/138 Addressing CSS Refactoring in Phoenix Live Dashboard
In contribution to the Phoenix Live Dashboard repository, I tackled an issue initially described by [JosÃ© Valim](https://x.com/josevalim), the creator of Elixir. This project provided an excellent opportunity to demonstrate my skills in CSS refactoring and component-based design.


## The Challenge

Encouraged by my mentor and colleague [@MachinesAreUs](https://x.com/MachinesAreUs), I set out to resolve a problem highlighted by [JosÃ© Valim](https://x.com/josevalim):

**The goal** was to refactor the CSS to decouple specific elements from their containers, thereby allowing for more modular and reusable components.

### My Approach

I began by decoupling the classes in color_bar_component, color_bar_legend, and table_component from their parent containers. The aim was to maintain semantic relationships while ensuring each class stood independently. Hereâ€™s an example of the restructuring:

ðŸ‘‰ [Accepted PR](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_dashboard/pull/227)

```scss
.color-bar {
  &-progress {
    border-radius: 2px;
    ...
    &-title {
      color: $color-gray-700;
      ...
    }
  }
}
```
The output classes were color-bar-progress and color-bar-progress-title.

Additionally, I:

* Split resource_usage.scss into color_bar.scss and color_bar_legend.scss, aligning these files with their respective components (color_bar_component.ex and color_bar_legend.ex).
* Renamed tabular_page.scss to table.scss, using a phx prefix to avoid clashes with Bootstrap's classes.
* Moved styles that only override Bootstrap into the extends folder and utility/helper styles into the utils folder.

### Feedback and Finalization

[JosÃ© Valim](https://x.com/josevalim) reviewed the pull request and provided positive feedback, along with a minor suggestion ðŸ˜±:

I addressed this feedback by refining the class naming strategy, leading to the approval and merging of the PR into the master branch.

Done! ðŸŽ‰

This experience was invaluable, allowing me to deepen my understanding of component-based architecture and CSS management in large projects. Itâ€™s a great addition to my portfolio, showcasing my ability to **contribute to and improve open-source projects**.
