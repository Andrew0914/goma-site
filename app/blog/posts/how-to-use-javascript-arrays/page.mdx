# How to use JavaScript Arrays: A Comprehensive Guide

This is your ultimate guide to JavaScript arrays. You will learn how to create, add, remove, filter, map, and reduce arrays and you become a javascript arrays master 🧙‍♂️✨.

## What is an Array?

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements. Each element in an array has a unique index that allows you to access it.

For example, imagine you need to store a collection of fruits in a box, this box has 4 compartments and you can store a fruit in each compartment and each compartment has a unique number that allows you to access the fruit in it.

And this is how you can represent it in code:

```javascript
// 🍉 is at index 0
const oranges = ["🍉", "🍊", "🍌", "🍎"];
```

## How to create an Array in JavaScript ?

You can create an array in different ways in JavaScript. The most common way is by using the array literal syntax, but there are other ways to create an array.

```javascript
// Array literal syntax
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];

// Another way to create an array is by using the `Array` constructor:
const fruits = new Array("🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊")
```

There are some other advanced ways to create arrays, for example, you can create an array with a fixed length and later fill it with values:

```javascript
// Create an array with a fixed length of 4
const fruits = new Array(4);

// Fill the array with values
fruits.fill("🍎"); // ['🍎', '🍎', '🍎', '🍎']

// creating an array from other collections like a string
const fruits = Array.from("🍎🍌🍇🍊"); // ['🍎', '🍌', '🍇', '🍊']
```

## How to access elements in an Array?

Let me show you how to access elements in an array with an example, imagine you have an array of fruits:

You can acces using the index of the element, in almost all programming languages the index starts at 0, so the first element in the array has an index of 0:

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];

// this is the static way to access elements in an array
console.log(fruits[0]); // 🍎
console.log(fruits[1]); // 🍌
console.log(fruits[2]); // 🍇
console.log(fruits[3]); // 🍊
```

In recent  years in ES2022 you can use `at()` method to access elements in an array:

```javascript
console.log(fruits.at(0)); // 🍎
console.log(fruits.at(1)); // 🍌
console.log(fruits.at(2)); // 🍇
console.log(fruits.at(3)); // 🍊
```

As you can see, you can access elements in an array using the index of the element similar to static way but `at()` is slightly different, let see:

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍉", "🍊", "🍌", "🍎"];

console.log(fruits.at(-1)); // 🍎
console.log(fruits[-1]); // undefined
```

The `at()` method allows you to access elements in an array using negative indexes, which is not possible with the static way, it is doing in circular way.

<Image src="/images/posts/array-circular.png" width={300} height={300} alt="fruits array" className="mx--5 center--x" />

In the example we are accessing the last elment because it is one position to the left (negative) of the first element, in this case the element in `-1` is `🍎`.

Using the static way to access elements in an array with a negative index will return `undefined` because it does not exist that position.

## How to get an element without an index?

You can get an element from an array without knowing its index using the `find()` method.

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];
const fruit = fruits.find(fruit => fruit === "🍌");
// The fruit "🍌"
```

In the above example, the condition to find the element is `fruit === "🍌"`, the `find()` method returns the first element that satisfies the condition.

We can also use more sofisticated conditions to find elements in an array, let's see how to do it.

```javascript	
const ages = [20, 30, 40, 50];
const age = ages.find(age => age > 30);
// The age 40
```

But we also can get the index of an element without knowing it using the `findIndex()` method similar to `find()` method but in this case it returns the index of the element.

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];
const index = fruits.findIndex(fruit => fruit === "🍌");
// The index 1
```

## How to add elements to an Array?

You can add elements to an array using different methods, the most common methods are `push()`, `unshift()`, and `splice()`.

### Using `push()` method

The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];
fruits.push("🥦"); // length 5
// The mutated array ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊", "🥦"]
```

### Using `unshift()` method

The `unshift()` method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];
fruits.unshift("🥦"); // length 5
// The mutated array ["🥦", "🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"]
```

### Using `splice()` method

The `splice()` method adds or removes elements from an array. You can use it to add elements to an array at a specific index.

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];
fruits.splice(2, 0, "🥦"); // []
// The mutated array ["🍎", "🍌", "🥦", "🍇", "🍊"]
```

In the example, the `splice()` method adds the element `🥦` at index 2, the second argument `0` is the number of elements to remove, in this case, we are not removing any element.

So now, you know how to add elements to an array, at the beginning, at the end, or at a specific index, let's learn how to remove elements from an array.

## How to remove elements from an Array?

You can remove elements from an array using different methods, the most common methods are `pop()`, `shift()`, and `splice()`.

### Using `pop()` method

The `pop()` method removes the last element from an array and returns the removed element.

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];
fruits.pop(); // "🍊"
// The mutated array ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇"]
```

### Using `shift()` method

The `shift()` method removes the first element from an array and returns the removed element.

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];
fruits.shift(); // "🍎"
// The mutated array ["🍌", "🍇", "🍊"]
```

### Using `splice()` method

The `splice()` method can also be used to remove elements from an array. You can use it to remove elements from a specific index.

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];
fruits.splice(2, 1); // ["🍇"]
// The mutated array ["🍎", "🍌", "🍊"]
```

In the example, the `splice()` method removes the element at index 2, the second argument `1` is the number of elements to remove, in this case, we are removing one element.

We can also remove elements using the `filter()` method, let's see how to do it.

## How to filter elements in an Array?

The `filter()` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];
const filteredFruits = fruits.filter(fruit => fruit !== "🍌");
// The filtered array ["🍎", "🍇", "🍊"]
```

This is one use case of the `filter()` method, but in general you can use it to filter elements based on any condition and return a new transformed array from the original.

## How to transforme an Array?

There are several methods in JavaScript that allow you to transform an array, we can get a new array filtered with the `filter()` method, we can get a new array with the elements transformed with the `map()` method, and we can get a single value from an array with the `reduce()` method.

### How to use the `map()` method?

The `map()` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.

Lets map the fruits into fresh fruits with map methods:

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];
const transformedFruits = fruits.map(fruit => `✨${fruit}✨`);
// The transformed array ["✨🍎✨", "✨🍌✨", "✨🍇✨", "✨🍊✨"]
```

Obviously in the real world you can do more complex transformations with the `map()` method, you can transform the elements in any way you want.

### How to use the `reduce()` method?

The `reduce()` method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

Let's reduce the fruits into a single string with the reduce method:

```javascript
const fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍇", "🍊"];
const reducedFruits = fruits.reduce((acc, fruit) => `${acc} ${fruit}`, "");
// The reduced value " 🍎 🍌 🍇 🍊"
```

In the example, the `reduce()` method concatenates all the fruits into a single string, the initial value of the accumulator is an empty string `""` and the reducer function concatenates the accumulator with each fruit, the result is a new accumulated string that is returned on each iteration.

Let's see how to use the `reduce()` method to sum all the elements in an array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, number) => acc + number, 0);
// 1 + 2 +3 + 4 + 5 = The sum 15
```

There are other methods in javascript arrays, but these are the most common methods that you will use in your day-to-day work.

But let's see some other methods that you can use to manipulate arrays and are useful in some cases.

## How to sort elements in an Array?

You can sort elements in an array using the `sort()` method.

```javascript
const numbes = ["0", "-1", "10", "2"];
const sortedNumbers = numbes.sort((a, b) => a - b);
// The sorted array ["-1", "0", "2", "10"]
```

In the example, the `sort()` method sorts the numbers in ascending order, the comparator function `(a, b) => a - b` compares two numbers and returns a negative number if `a` is less than `b`, a positive number if `a` is greater than `b`, and zero if `a` is equal to `b`.

You can also sort elements in descending order by changing the comparator function to `(a, b) => b - a`.


Finally there are 2 other methods I like to use in arrays, the `every()` and `some()` methods, that personally I use them a lot in my day-to-day work.

## How to check if all elements in an Array pass a test?

The `every()` method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const allNumbersArePositive = numbers.every(number => number > 0);
// The result is true
```

In the example, the `every()` method checks if all numbers in the array are positive, the condition is `number > 0`, and the result is `true` because all numbers are positive.

## How to check if some elements in an Array pass a test?

The `some()` method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const someNumbersAreEven = numbers.some(number => number % 2 === 0);
// The result is true
```

In the example, the `some()` method checks if at least one number in the array is even, the condition is `number % 2 === 0`, and the result is `true` because there are even numbers in the array.
